Time series forecasting is the use of a statistical model to predict future values, based on past results.

So what kinds of variables can we forecast?
Any value that can be tracked and collected over time.


The time series will need a numeric variable that we'd like to predict.
This is our target variable. And it also needs a time based variable.

Now, to accurately forecast future values, we'll need each measurement of data to be taken across sequential and equal intervals, and with each time
unit having at most one data point.

Once we have collected our data, as a business analyst, we have two objectives in mind:
First, identifying the patterns represented by the sequence of observations, and 
Second, forecasting or predicting future values of the time series.

A time series plot shows a graphical presentation of the relationship
between time and the time series target variable.
Time is on the horizontal axis and
the target variable's values are shown on the vertical axis.

In time series analysis, a trend is a gradual shift or movement to relatively higher or lower values over a long period of time.

When our trend pattern exhibits a general direction that is upward,
where there are higher highs and higher lows, we call this an uptrend.
When our trend pattern exhibits a general direction that is down, where there are lower highs and lower lows, we call this a downtrend.
 
A time series can experience changing direction where it can go from
an Uptrend to a Downtrend.

If there were no trend, we call it a Horizontal or stationary trend.

Each trend we see in a time series is called the trend cycle.

############ DIfference bet cycle and seasonality ##################

A time series that exhibits a repeating pattern at fixed intervals of time
within a one year period is said to have a seasonal pattern or seasonality.
If pattern repeats each year at the same time intervals, we can safely say that our time series contains seasonality.

A cyclical pattern exists, when data exhibits rises and falls that are not of a fixed period.

If the fluctuations are not of a fixed period, then they are cyclical.
If the period is unchanging and associated with some aspect of the
calendar, then the pattern is seasonal.

In general, with cyclical patterns, the average length of cycles is longer
than the length of the seasonal pattern.
And the magnitude of cycles tends to change more than the magnitude of
seasonal patterns.

Also, cyclical patterns are much harder to predict as well.
The decline in stock markets is often sudden and violent, all coming as
a surprise to most.

######################################################### Diff bet prediction and forecasting #############
Difference Between FORECAST and PREDICTION 


Forecasting is an extrapolation of past into the future while prediction is judgmental and takes into account changes taking place in the future. 
Therefore, prediction is utilized more in business and economics while forecasting takes place in weather and earthquakes.

Predicting is saying or telling something before the event while forecasting is done on the basis of analysis of the past.

Forecasting is still not a complete science as there are chances of error.

################################## When to use time series vs Linear regression #################### 

a linear regression analysis is good for simple relationships like height and age or time studying and GPA, 
if we want to look at relationships over time in order to identify trends, we use a time series regression analysis.
